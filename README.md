# streaming-05-smart-smoker - Julia Fangman - May 28, 2024


### The Problem / Challenge To Solve
We want to stream information from a smart smoker. Read one value every half minute. (sleep_secs = 30)

smoker-temps.csv has 4 columns:

[0] Time = Date-time stamp for the sensor reading
[1] Channel1 = Smoker Temp --> send to message queue "01-smoker"
[2] Channel2 = Food A Temp --> send to message queue "02-food-A"
[3] Channel3 = Food B Temp --> send to message queue "03-food-B"

##### Requirements
RabbitMQ server running
pika installed in your active environment
RabbitMQ Admin
See http://localhost:15672/Links to an external site.

### Task 1. Create a Place to Work
In GitHub, create a new repo for your project - name it streaming-05-smart-smoker.
Add a README.md during the creation process. (If not, you can always add it later.)
Clone your repo down to your machine. 
In VS Code, add a .gitignore (use one from an earlier module), start working on the README.md. Create it if you didn't earlier.
Add the csv data file to your repo. 
Create a file for your bbq producer.


### Task 2. Design and Implement Your Producer
Implement your bbq producer. More detailed help provided in links below. 
Use the logic, approach, and structure from Module 4, version 2 and version 3.
These provide a current and solid foundation for streaming analytics - modifying them to serve your purpose IS part of the assignment.
Do not start from scratch - do not search for code - do not use a notebook.
Use comments in the code and repo to explain your work. 
Use docstring comments and add your name and date to your README and your code files. 
Explain your project in the README. Include prerequisites and how to run your code. 
Document your project works - display screenshots of your console and maybe the RabbitMQ console. 
If you only have a producer, you won't have a consumer showing messages yet, so you'll need to be creative. We'll build the consumers next.


### Required Approach
Use your Module 4 projects (Version 2 and Version 3) as examples.
Remember: No prior coding experience is required to take this course. Rely heavily on the working examples from earlier modules. 
The more similar your code looks to the examples - the more credit earned.
Vastly different approaches can be expected to earn less credit not more.
This project should clearly build on skills and code we've already mastered. If not, let me know and more help will be provided. 
The primary difference should be going from 1 to 3 queue_names and from 1 to 3 callbacks. 
Part of the challenge is to implement analytics using the tools and approach provided (don't significantly refactor the codebase during your first week of work!) 
AFTER earning credit for the assignment, THEN create and share additional custom projects. 
 

### Some Other Points - Why? Professional Practice
At work, you'll be expected to contribute meaningfully and solve a variety of issues on your own.
You'll also be part of a team. We all need to balance working on our own, and maintaining productivity by asking for help to get past obstacles.
The goal is to be ready to be onboarded effectively into an existing team, with pre-established ways of doing things.
At this point in your career, don't get too attached to any preferences.
Many things will be set by your team lead.
On a team, you'll likely autoformat your code on commit (have you read about Black?) and use various automatic static analysis tools and linters like Prospector and flake8. Commits may need to pass unit tests before you can push. 
Focus on being a great team player, able to join a team with little disruption, follow your team's conventions, and begin contributing productively. 

### Guided Producer Design 
If this is the main program being executed (and you're not importing it for its functions),
We should call a function to ask the user if they want to see the RabbitMQ admin webpage.
We should call a function to begin the main work of the program.
As part of the main work, we should
Get a connection to RabbitMQ, and a channel, delete the 3 existing queues (we'll likely run this multiple times), and then declare them anew. 
Open the csv file for reading (with appropriate line endings in case of Windows) and create a csv reader.
For data_row in reader:
[0] first column is the timestamp - we'll include this with each of the 3 messages below
[1] Channel1 = Smoker Temp --> send to message queue "01-smoker"
[2] Channe2 = Food A Temp --> send to message queue "02-food-A"
[3] Channe3 = Food B Temp --> send to message queue "02-food-B"
Send a tuple of (timestamp, smoker temp) to the first queue
Send a tuple of (timestamp, food A temp) to the second queue
Send a tuple of (timestamp, food B temp) to the third queue 
Create a binary message from our tuples before using the channel to publish each of the 3 messages.
Messages are strings, so use float() to get a numeric value where needed
 Remember to use with to read the file, or close it when done.
